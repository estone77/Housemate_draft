Project name: Housemate

Description: An app to centralize all roommate chores, events, and needed shopping.

MVP: Can add to a list of chores, assign them, edit them. The greater of the chore can edit the chore but others can only marked them as complete. Can add roommate bio and edit; can add a roommate. Roommate bios will be displayed on the main page in rotating cards which can be interacted with using javascript. Can add events to a chronological table of upcoming events, include attendees and other requests from housemates such as a request to use the public space. Can add to a grocery list and check off if items were bought. 

Bonus: add a comment section to the chore details page. One person can comment on many chores and one chore can be commented on by many people.  I will also use bootstrap. If I have time I will try to push this to PROD using GitHub.
